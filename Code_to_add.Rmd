p1 + theme_gray() # the default
#The signature ggplot2 theme with a grey background and white gridlines,
#' designed to put the data forward yet make comparisons easy.
p1 + theme_bw()
#The classic dark-on-light ggplot2 theme. May work better for presentations
#' displayed with a projector.
p1 + theme_linedraw()
#A theme with only black lines of various widths on white backgrounds,
#' reminiscent of a line drawing. Serves a purpose similar to `theme_bw()`.
#' Note that this theme has some very thin lines 
p1 + theme_light()
#A theme similar to `theme_linedraw()` but with light grey lines and axes,
#' to direct more attention towards the data.
p1 + theme_dark()
#The dark cousin of `theme_light()`, with similar line sizes but a dark background. Useful to make thin coloured lines pop out.
p1 + theme_minimal()
#A minimalistic theme with no background annotations.}
p1 + theme_classic()
#A classic-looking theme, with x and y axis lines and no gridlines
