# Instructions for use

* The Sustainable Food Lab created this document to support companies and research organizations who are visualizing income data and its relationship to established Living Income Benchmarks. This document supplements tools developed by KIT to generate these graphics in [Stata and Excel] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10f3vP7j2WFgNKm1t1s4PrwzpSwCHSlzn).     

* The advantages of data cleaning, management, and visualization in R programming language are countless and include: free open source use, reproducibility and documentation of data cleaning, seamless integration with GitHub (a software/platform to track, store, and collaborate on code scripts), and flexible functions. 

* While the code presented in this document is intended to be as user friendly as possible, some basic knowledge of R is necessary. The user will need to understand how to navigate the basic R interface to run the script and export desired graphics. 

# Setup

* The example graphs below visualize a publicly-available data set based on previous work of KIT for the Living Income Community of Practice.

* The sample data set assigns different Living Income benchmarks to different household types. No changes to the code are necessary if your data only has one benchmark for all household types or genders.  

* To run your own data through the code provided below, it is imperative that you format your data in exactly the same structure as the sample data set. See the KIT Excel format [HERE] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10f3vP7j2WFgNKm1t1s4PrwzpSwCHSlzn) to copy the exact column names for each key variable. If you alter any column names in your data file, you will need to update this code accordingly. Ensure that you format all numerical variables without any commas or currency notations.  

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
## Fist, load the R libraries that have the necessary functions for this analysis. 

# If you have not previously used these libraries, 
# you will need to instaLl them with the function install.packages("LIBRARY NAME")
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(scales)

## Import data set

# If you have troubles with the import, 
# ensure the original data file is stored in your "working directory"
# (most often the same folder you have saved your working code script)

# If your original data file is saved as an Excel, export it as a CSV file.
# Ensure the top row is only column names.
# Replace 'KIT_Sample_Data' with the name of your data file.

DATA <- read_csv("KIT_Sample_Data.csv")
```

```{r, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Pull in full cleaned Guatemala data
all <- read_csv("full_data.csv")

all$gap <- 6844 - all$total_income_U
all$Gender[all$Gender == "F"] <- "Female-headed"
all$Gender[all$Gender == "M"] <- "Male-headed"

# Share of those below the Living Income Benchmark - distributional plot 
The KIT Guidance Document displays this graph style as a smooth histogram with binned income ranges. However, for a variety of reasons, we felt that the data would be better visualized with a density graph. Furthermore, these income bins do not form a smooth line when there are a smaller number of observations (the data set for the KIT example graphs has 934 observations, while not all data sets will have this many observations).

For these reasons, the code and examples below are for a density graph instead of a smooth histogram. The area under a density curve equals 1, and since the income values (x-axis) are so high, the density values (y-axis) were very small numbers and not useful. I therefore removed the y-axis ticks. 

## Sample Graph
```{r, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
all %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total_income_U)) +
  geom_density(color = "#add8e6", fill = "#add8e6") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 6844, color = "Living Income Benchmark")) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(all$total_income_U), color = "Income Mean")) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(all$total_income_U), color = "Income Median")) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Total Income",
       x = "Estimated Total Household Income (USD/year/household)",
       y = "Proportion of households") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma, limits = c(0,10000)) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Legend", 
                     values = c("Living Income Benchmark"= "red",
                                "Income Mean"= "blue",
                                "Income Median"="green"))
```

## Sample Code
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
DATA %>%
  # Set x-axis to key variable
  ggplot(aes(x = HOUSEHOLD INCOME COLUMN)) +
  # Add density line. You can change the fill and line colors.
  geom_density(color = "#add8e6", fill = "#add8e6") +
  # Add vertical line for living income
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = LIVING INCOME BENCHMARK, 
                 color = "Living Income Benchmark")) +
  # Add vertical line for mean income 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(DATA$HOUSEHOLD INCOME COLUMN), 
                 color = "Income Mean")) +
  # Add vertical line for median income
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(DATA$HOUSEHOLD INCOME COLUMN), 
                 color = "Income Median")) +
  # Add graph and axis labels
  labs(title = "Distribution of Total Income",
       x = "Estimated Total Household Income (USD/year/household)",
       y = "Proportion of households") +
  # Format x-axis labels as numbers with commas
  # Add x-axis limits so outliers do not warp graph 
  # Limits are optional depending on data
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma, limits = c(0,10000)) +
  # Remove y-axis labels and ticks
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  # Remove background grid (the grid is the default)
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  # Manually add legend 
  scale_color_manual(name = "Legend", 
                     values = c("Living Income Benchmark"= "red",
                                "Income Mean"= "blue",
                                "Income Median"="green"))
```
