# Instructions for use

* The Sustainable Food Lab created this document to support companies and research organizations who are visualizing income data and its relationship to established Living Income Benchmarks. This document supplements tools developed by KIT to generate these graphics in [Stata and Excel](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10f3vP7j2WFgNKm1t1s4PrwzpSwCHSlzn).     

* The advantages of data cleaning, management, and visualization in R programming language are countless and include: free open source use, reproducibility and documentation of data cleaning, seamless integration with GitHub (a software/platform to track, store, and collaborate on code scripts), and flexible functions. 

* While the code presented in this document is intended to be as user friendly as possible, some basic knowledge of R is necessary. The user will need to understand how to navigate the basic R interface to run the script and export desired graphics. 

* The example graphs below visualize a publicly-available data set based on previous work of KIT for the Living Income Community of Practice.

* The sample data set assigns different Living Income benchmarks to different household types. No changes to the code are necessary if your data only has one benchmark for all household types or genders.  

* **To run your own data through the code provided below, it is imperative that you format your data in exactly the same structure as the sample data set. See the KIT Excel format [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10f3vP7j2WFgNKm1t1s4PrwzpSwCHSlzn) to copy the exact column names for each key variable. If you alter any column names in your data file, you will need to update this code accordingly. Ensure that you format all numerical variables without any commas or currency notations.**

# Troubleshooting
If you are encountering challenges and/or errors when running this code, try these five initial troubleshooting: 
1. Check your 'working directory' and ensure it is the same file destination as where you have saved your data file CSV. A working directory error would occur when trying to upload the data file in the setup.  

2. Ensure all the required libraries are installed on your computer. If you have never used the tidyverse, knitr, or scales libraries, you will need to individually install them first with the function install.packages("LIBRARY NAME").

3. Ensure your data file formatting aligns exactly with the sample excel. The column names must be exactly the same without additional spaces or formatting. Ensure that you format all numerical variables without any commas or currency notations and any blank values are assigned NA.

4. Check for extreme data outliers. Very large, small, or negative income calculations will result in skewed visualizations and could even lead to errors when running the code.

5. Copy the exact error message from R into Google as someone has almost always previously asked about the error message on the forum StackOverflow. 

If you have further questions about this document, please reach out to the Living Income Community of Practice at livingincome@isealalliance.org.

# Setup

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#### Before continuing any further, load the R libraries that have the necessary functions for this analysis. 

# If you have not previously used these libraries, 
# you will need to instaLl them with the function install.packages("LIBRARY NAME"). For example: install.packages(tidyverse)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(scales)
```

# User entered data

This section allows the user to enter the information specific to their dataset. The user should replace all the wording in ALL CAPS in the following code chunk.   

```{r}
#### Step 1: Import data set

# If you have troubles with the import, 
# ensure the original data file is stored in your "working directory"
# (most often the same folder you have saved your working code script)

# If your original data file is saved as an Excel, export it (from Excel,
  # 'save as') as a CSV file before importing it here.
# Ensure the top row of the Excel/CSV is only column names.

DF <- read_csv("NAME OF DATA FILE.csv")

## Make all column names syntactically valid
# In R, column names must only consist of letters, numbers, periods, 
  # and underscores. They cannot start with a number nor include spaces.
# If your excel has any column names that do not comply with this syntax,
  # the below code will alter the names accordingly. 

names(DF) <- make.names(names(DF), unique=TRUE)

#### Step 2: Replace variable names
# In the below section, replace the words in all caps with the column   
  # name present in your dataset. 
# Ensure that you write the column name exactly as it appears in the CSV file. 
# R variable names 
income_main_crop <- "ANNUAL INCOME FROM MAIN CROP"
other_income <- "HH INCOME FROM ALL OTHER SOURCES"
grouping <- "A valid variable name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters. The variable name starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number."

#### Step 3
currency 
# If you do not already have a variable for total income,
  # you can enter the income_main_crop
total_hh_income <- "TOTAL HH INCOME"

  
variable names, graph label information, colors, etc, 
```


```{r}

DF <- read_csv("KIT_Sample_Data.csv")

income_main_crop <- income_main_crop
other_income <- 
total_hh_income <- total_hh_income
